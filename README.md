# Minimal First-Person Shooter Template for O3DE

![Cover](./docs/images/cover.png)

This template provides a starting point to create a **First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game** in [O3DE (Open 3D Engine)](https://www.o3de.org) using the supported scripting languages (i.e. **Lua**, **ScriptCanvas**).

It includes the core mechanic for rotating the camera and throwing projectiles against targets. After being hit, a target is restored to its initial position automatically.

This template is part of a wider collection that covers several game genres. Please refer to the [parent repository](https://github.com/matteogrs/templates.o3de.minimal) for the full list of available templates and more details about the design philosophy behind them.

## Install
1. Install [O3DE (Open 3D Engine)](https://www.o3de.org) following the steps that are described in [Get Started](https://www.o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/setup/) page of the official documentation.

	> The engine version must support `Script-only` mode (2409.1 or greater).

2. Launch `Project Manager`, as it is described in the [dedicated section](https://www.o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/create/creating-projects-using-project-manager/#launch-project-manager) of the official documentation.
3. Choose `Engine` tab, and then select `Remote Sources` subsection.
4. Press `Add Repository` button and paste the address of this repository:
```
https://github.com/matteogrs/templates.o3de.minimal.first-shooter/raw/refs/tags/v1.0.0-beta.1
```
5. Return to `Projects` tab, and press `New Project...` button. Confirm the action by selecting `Create New Project` option in the dropdown menu.
6. Scroll down to `Select a Project Template` section, and select the variant of **Minimal First-Person Shooter** in your preferred scripting language. The small cloud icon that is visible in its top-right corner suggests that the template files still need to be downloaded from the remote repository.
7. In the right panel, press `Download Template` button and wait for its completion.
8. Fill out the remaining fields as you wish, and press `Create Project` to continue.
9. In the main page, press `Build Project` button on the icon of the new created project.

	> No C++ compiler is needed at this stage. Only the required runtime files are copied from the engine directory to the project one.

10. The project is now ready. You can start playing it by pressing `Open Editor` button.
